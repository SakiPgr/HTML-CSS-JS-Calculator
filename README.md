# HTML-CSS-JS-Calculator
A calculator made following a tutorial

I made this calculator following the tutorial found on youtube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw
The original file of this tutorial is found here on github. https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Vanilla-JavaScript-Calculator

While following this tutorial I took the liberty to make changes as I saw fit. This caused some bugs based on those changes I made. I fixed those bugs so that the final product works just like the original. (At least I hope so)
